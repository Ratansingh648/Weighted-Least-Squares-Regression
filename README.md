# Partially Weighted-Least-Squares-Regression
This Repository contains a flavor of implementation of Weighted Least Squares Regression method from scratch, 


Partially Weighted Least Square Regression algorithm is a powerful technique when your data contains high degree of correlation. It is also helpful when you have large number of independent variables.

## How it is different from PCR (Principal component Regression)

Both techniques create new independent variables called components which are linear combinations of the original predictor variables but PCR creates components to explain the observed variability in the predictor variables, without considering the response variable at all. While PLS takes the dependent variable into account, and therefore often leads to models that are able to fit the dependent variable with fewer components.
